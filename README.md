About
---

The aim of this project is to provide the essential tools to work with sequencing data stored in the FastQ format.
We are aiming to provide an extensive API to the fileformat, file-mangling as conversion, extraction, validation.

On the FastA part we invite you to submit a ticket to tell us what to support.
